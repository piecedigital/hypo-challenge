## How to run

Prerequisites: You need NodeJS installed. This was developed on Node version 6.11.0, but some older versions (like 4.x) should work just fine.

1. Clone the repository in your favorite folder: `https://github.com/piecedigital/hypo-challenge.git`
2. CD into the directory: `cd hypo-challenge`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Run the server: `node server.js`
